This is a project done by @Mayanwolfe from 100Devs stream team for the purpose of helping one of her local museum to create a grave registry app to get an easy access to the list of people with their info and the location of the grave that are registered in that specific graveyard.

The purpose of me doing this project is solely learning purposes, none of this code/work is my own. All credit goes to Mayanwolfe.
