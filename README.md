# Python Learning Journey

## Overview

This repository documents my progression in learning Python programming, following the Python for Everybody (py4e) curriculum and supplementary projects. Each project demonstrates practical implementation of Python concepts, from basic programming fundamentals to more advanced topics.

## Skills & Concepts Covered

- Basic Python Syntax and Data Types
- Control Flow (Conditionals, Loops)
- Functions and Error Handling
- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)
- Database Integration (MySQL)
- File Operations
- Clean Code Principles

## Projects

### 1. Number Guessing Game

A interactive game demonstrating core Python concepts.

**Features:**

- Multiple difficulty levels
- High score tracking with MySQL database
- Error handling and input validation
- User-friendly interface
- Replay functionality

**Technologies Used:**

- Python 3.x
- MySQL
- Virtual Environment
